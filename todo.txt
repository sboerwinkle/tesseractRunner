Probably get rid of the indicators, they're rather ugly.

Add more lines. At least one more dimension of density - I ought to be able to see the bounding edges of the thing I'm on.
Possibly more lines, so I can see the surface I'm standing on.

Can I find a good way to interpolate? I sure hope so! Because I'm pretty sure the math for more lines will prove damn ugly otherwise!!!
